# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Material Renderers Package

This is the JSON Forms Material Renderers Package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with [JSON Forms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react).

You can combine [JSON Forms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react) with other renderers too, for example with the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

Check <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms> for all published JSONForms packages.

## License

The JSON Forms project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.
